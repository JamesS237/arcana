<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Let's face it. School can be a bit dull, especially if you're good at it. 
	Whether your specialty lies in just one subject, or across many, sometimes it can seem like there's not much to gain from being good.
	The tasks are unimportant, or you don't intend to do anything remotely like that in VCE.</p>
	
<p>It doesn't have to be that way. For many of us, competition enlivens anything and adds a sense of value. That Geography assignment might be 
	pretty stupid, but if you beat your mates, and everyone knows about it, suddenly the interest level rises. At Arcana, we believe in 
	fostering a productive and fun environment at school through competition.</p>
